A collection of simple Python functions for working with statistical data. I am only just learning as I go, so this is partly a personal sandbox.

_faocodes.py_:  Gives FAOSTAT numerical codes for countries or commodities, and vice versa. I eventually intend to use this to request data with Quandl.

_firstchart.py_: A simple practice/demonstration using Pandas and PyPlot. So far it loads a huge FAOSTAT dataset into a smaller file. Soon it will plot a simple chart.
