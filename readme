This is a collection of Python functions for working with statistical data. I am a novice coder, learning as I go.

_faocodes.py_:  Gets FAOSTAT country and item codes, to help with requesting data.

_firstchart.py_: Loads a huge FAOSTAT dataset into a smaller file and plots a simple chart, mainly as a personal learning excercise for myself.
