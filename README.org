A collection of Python tools for working with FAOSTAT and other data related to global development, economic history and agriculture.  

I am a novice learning as I go, so this is more like a personal sandbox then a reliable repository.
* faocodes
Looks up [[http://faostat3.fao.org/][FAOSTAT]] numerical codes for countries or commodities, and vice versa. I eventually intend to use this to request data via API with Quandl.
* faoplot 
Will automatically generate plots from FAOSTAT data, based on lists of items, element and country codes. 
* oldmoney 
Will use the [[https://github.com/hgrecco/pint][Pint]] library to work with data given in pre-decimal British pounds (Â£sd).
