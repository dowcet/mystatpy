A collection of Python tools for basic statistics related to global development, agriculture and economic history. The main focus for now is on [[http://faostat3.fao.org/][FAOSTAT]] production and trade data.   

I am a novice coder still learning as I go, so this is something of a personal sandbox. But I hope others will use and help improve on what's here. 
* datapeek
Functions for having a look at what is in a Pandas dataframe, extending on `.describe()` and `.head()` 
* faocodes 
Looks up FAO numerical codes for countries or commodities (including their descriptions), and vice versa. For now it uses a `members.json` file downloaded from [[http://data.fao.org/developers/api/v1/en/resources/members.json?pageSize=1000&fields=mnemonic%2Clabel%40en%2Cproperties.*][this link]]. I eventually hope to use it to request data via API with Quandl.
** TODO
*** replace members.json with files from [[http://fenixapps.fao.org/repository/api/][the newer API]] and add a function to update them
*** improve command line output to give lists of countries and commodities sorted separately
*** expand to other datasets / source
*** integrate with faoplot to generate plots
* faoplot 
Generate plots from FAOSTAT data, based on lists of items, element and country codes. The idea is to make multiple plots automatically, but it's not there yet. Uses `faocodes` as a library.
** TODO 
*** automatically set axis labels
*** iterate through lists to make multiple plots
* oldmoney
An example using the [[https://github.com/hgrecco/pint][Pint]] library to work with data given in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd][pre-decimal British pounds]] (e.g. Â£2 3s 6d).
