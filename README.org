* Overview
A collection of simple Python functions for working with statistical data. I am only just learning as I go, so this is partly a personal sandbox.
* Contents
*faocodes.py*:  Gives [[http://faostat3.fao.org/][FAOSTAT]] numerical codes for countries or commodities, and vice versa. I eventually intend to use this to request data with Quandl.

*oldmoney.py*: Uses the [[https://github.com/hgrecco/pint][Pint]] library to make sense of prices given in pre-decimal British pounds (i.e. with shillings and pence). 

*firstchart.py*: A simple practice/demonstration using Pandas and PyPlot. So far it loads a huge FAOSTAT dataset into a smaller file. Soon it will plot a simple chart.
